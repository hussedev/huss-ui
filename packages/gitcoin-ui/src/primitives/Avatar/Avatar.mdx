# Avatar

<Meta of={AvatarStories} />

The Avatar component displays a rounded image which can be used to render Logos and Avatars.

This component supports multiple data sources, with an explicit priority ordering if multiple are used

First, the component will attempt to load an IPFS CID, if that doesn't exist it will attempt to load an image URL.

If both of these sources fail, it will attempt to stylize the `fallbackName` down to 2 characters.  
If the name is multiple words, it will use the first letter of each word. If it is one word, it will use the first two letters of that word.

If everything fails, it will render the default Logo.

# Priority of Sources (in order)

- Nothing is passed in -> Default Logo
- IPFS CID and an empty or null URL -> ipfsBaseURL + ipfsCid
- URL and an empty or null IPFS CID -> URL
- both an IPFS CID and a URL -> ipfsBaseURL + ipfsCID
- both images fail -> fallback name

# Example

## With Image

<Story of={AvatarStories.sourceFromIPFS} />
## With Fallback Name
<Story of={AvatarStories.FallbackName} />

# Controls

# Other variations
