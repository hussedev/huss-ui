# BannerImage

<Meta of={BannerImageStories} />

The BannerImage component displays a 3:1 image which can be used to render Banner Images.  
The Width of the image can be explicitly set in `px`, or it will auto-scale to fit the width of it's parent.

## Image Source

This component supports multiple data sources, with an explicit priority ordering if multiple are used

First, the component will attempt to load an IPFS CID, if that doesn't exist it will attempt to load an image URL.

If both of those don't exist, it will render the default Logo.

# Priority of Sources (in order)

- Nothing is passed in -> Default Logo
- IPFS CID and an empty or null URL -> ipfsBaseURL + ipfsCid
- URL and an empty or null IPFS CID -> URL
- both an IPFS CID and a URL -> ipfsBaseURL + ipfsCID

# Example

## With Image
